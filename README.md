##Inspiration 
After taking part in my first hackathon when I was 15, and creatign a pet expense tracker, I decided to take my SQL knowedge and GUI capabilities to the next level. I wanted to create an app that would help my family and other peopel monitor their finances. This is app focuses on the simplicity on just keeping track of how you spend your money. 

## What I learned 
- Pyqt5
- Matplotlib 
- More from SQL
This project allowed me to become more confident in my Object Oriented programming skills, and allowed me to work with new technologies I have previous not worked with before such as a powerful GUI builder "Pyqt5". I was able to learn how to efficiently use Matplot lib to implement graphs and a pie chart. Lastly, I became more familar with SQL commands in python and using better practices to retrieve data.
